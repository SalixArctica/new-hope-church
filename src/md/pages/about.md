New Hope loves the Lord God Almighty Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and when you love the Lord you will love

New Hope loves the Lord God Almighty Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and when you love the Lord you will love people. New Hope loves the Lord, and loves people.

## Loving God = Care & Benevolence

New Hope’s definition of Loving God is “A compassionate love for God that is lived out in our actions.” New Hope does this through acts of care and benevolent missions in our communities, Oklahoma, the United States and the world.

## Giving Hope = Evangelism

New Hope’s definition of Giving Hope is “Actively giving Hope through the Good News of God's love, Mercy, and grace.” New Hope actively presents the Gospel of Jesus Christ through outreach and missions continually bringing people to the Lord Jesus Christ for salvation and His abundant life in our communities, Oklahoma, the United States and the world.

## Loving People = Discipleship

New Hope’s definition of Loving People is “Loving people by actively demonstrating God's life changing power.” We can see discipleship at New Hope in so many people here that at one time were far from God, not being used of God, & not even considering being used of God. We see every Sunday changed people that were not going to church, then going to church, but not serving. Who now are going to church & serving God in many different capacities. Many of those who were not, are now actively Loving God by bringing others to Christ, then disciplining them in serving Christ and who are enjoying a loving relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ.

## Teaching Truth = Teaching and Preaching the God’s Word

New Hope’s definition of Teaching Truth is “Actively teaching God's Biblical Truth for practical daily living.” We believe the Bible, God’s Word is infallible and without error.

Matthew 7:28-29 says, “And so it was, when Jesus had ended these sayings, that the people were astonished at His teaching, for He taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.”

At New Hope we preach and teach the word of God, and not the opinions of men or women. Hebrew 4:12 “For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discern-er of the thoughts and intents of the heart.”
